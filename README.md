# Fivetran_Connector_SDK
 Weather connector using the Fivetran SDK

This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module. It shows the use of a requirements.txt file and a connector that calls a publicly available API to get the weather forecast data for Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, USA. It also shows how to use the logging functionality provided by fivetran_connector_sdk, by logging important steps using log.info() and log.fine()

See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update) and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.
