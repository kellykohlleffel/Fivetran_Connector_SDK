"""
connector.py

This script connects to TheMealDB API using the Fivetran Connector SDK. 
It retrieves information about meals, including meal name, category, cuisine, 
instructions, and main ingredients, and stores this data in Fivetran 
using the SDK's upsert operation.

Example usage: This script can be used to demonstrate pulling meal data 
from TheMealDB, making it useful for showcasing how the Fivetran Connector SDK works.

Requirements:
- No additional Python libraries are required, as `requests` and the 
  `fivetran_connector_sdk` are assumed to be pre-installed.
